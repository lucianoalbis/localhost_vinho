PSX Framework

## About

PSX is a framework written in PHP dedicated to build RESTful APIs. It is based
on multiple components which cover many aspects of the API lifecycle. These
components are independent of the framework and can also be used in another
context. The following list contains the most notable packages:

- [psx/api](https://github.com/apioo/psx-api)
  Parse and generate API specification formats (i.e. RAML)
- [psx/data](https://github.com/apioo/psx-data)
  Data processing library to read and write POPOs in different formats
- [psx/schema](https://github.com/apioo/psx-schema)
  Parse and generate data schema formats (i.e. JsonSchema)
- [psx/sql](https://github.com/apioo/psx-sql)
  Build complex data structures from relational databases
- [psx/framework](https://github.com/apioo/psx-framework)
  Engine of the PSX framework
